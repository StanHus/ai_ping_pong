Analyze the current state and future potential of quantum computing in cybersecurity applications, focusing on post-quantum cryptography implementations. I need this for a strategic technology roadmap presentation to enterprise security leaders in March 2025.

Include:

- Latest breakthroughs in quantum-resistant algorithms (past 6 months)
- Current industry adoption rates and enterprise readiness assessments
- Specific vendor solutions and their cryptographic approaches
- Timeline predictions for quantum threat realization
- Cost-benefit analysis for early vs. late adoption
- Regulatory compliance considerations (NIST, EU standards)
- Case studies of organizations already implementing post-quantum solutions

The audience includes CTOs, CISOs, and security architects who need actionable insights, not theoretical explanations. They want to know: Should we start migrating now or wait? What's the ROI? What are the risks of each approach?

Make it comprehensive but digestible - about 2500-3000 words with clear sections, current data, and credible sources throughout.
